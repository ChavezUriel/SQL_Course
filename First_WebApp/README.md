The final exercise of the course was to create a web app using what we learned on node.js and the basics on web pace structuration (HTML and CSS).
The HTML scripts are read by node.js via EJS which is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript
The created web page has a home page where emails are asked for a registration, the emails entered are stored in a database in which fake email data was inserted before. After entering an email, it redirects to a "Thanks" page where you can chose to return to the home page or acces to the "More about" page.
The images included in this directory show the appearance of the three pages described.
